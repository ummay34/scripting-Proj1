Github Component for Scripting Project

### Overview

The problem descriptions and details are on Prairielearn.
For the github component of the project, you will need
to commit and upload your code to this github repo.

Your score for the github component will be based on:
* Commit message quality (try to have some of them
  be decent).  This won't be judged that harshly, but
  random letters or primarily one word commit messages
  will lose you points.  I expect these to be something
  you could actually use.
* Number of commits (the point here isn't to have a bunch
  of commits, just to make sure you are committing along
  the way -- having only 1 commit will definitely
  lose you points).  At the bare minimum, I expect
  one commit per part of the project.
